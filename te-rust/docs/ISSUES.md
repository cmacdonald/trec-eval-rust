# `te-rust` Design and Implementation Issues

This document tracks active design questions, structural decisions, and implementation tasks for the `te-rust` project. Issues are categorized by type and updated as we progress.

## Resolved Issues

### 1. Unified vs. Hierarchical Flat Arrays (De-duplication of Query IDs)
*   **Type**: Design
*   **Status**: Resolved (Option B)
*   **Description**: Resolved to use hierarchical structs (`RunQuery`, `QrelsQuery`) to group records by `qid`, avoiding duplicate query ID string allocations and naturally aligning with C's query grouping.

### 2. Stream-based Reading and I/O Genericity
*   **Type**: Design
*   **Status**: Resolved (Option B)
*   **Description**: Decided to use standard `std::io::BufRead` trait for parser inputs. This decouples the core parsing logic from physical file opening, allows simple unit testing using in-memory byte streams, and directly enables parsing from Standard Input (`stdin`).

### 3. Immediate Abort vs. Collected Errors during Parsing
*   **Type**: Design
*   **Status**: Resolved (Option A)
*   **Description**: Decided to abort parsing immediately on the first syntax error. To compensate for not collecting errors, we will heavily prioritize highly detailed and helpful error diagnostics (including line numbers, raw line contents, expected format, and the reason for parsing failure).

### 4. Sorting non-Ord floats (`f64`) in Rust
*   **Type**: Design
*   **Status**: Resolved (Option A)
*   **Description**: Resolved to explicitly validate during parsing that all similarity scores are valid finite numbers (rejecting `NaN` and `Infinity` with an error). This guarantees that `.partial_cmp().unwrap()` is entirely safe and infallible for sorting without needing third-party wrapper dependencies.

### 5. Configuration Metadata in Comments
*   **Type**: Design/Future Feature
*   **Status**: Open
*   **Description**: File comments starting with `#` could contain inline configuration metadata (formatted as JSON or TOML block headers). We would like to parse these comments during run/qrels file ingestion and possibly use them to override or specify default evaluation settings (e.g. measure parameters) instead of relying solely on CLI flags.
*   **Options**:
    *   **Option A**: Store all comment lines in a structured metadata field within `RunData` and `QrelsData` structures during parsing, and defer JSON/TOML parsing to a separate post-parser config step.
    *   **Option B**: Skip comment storage for the MVP and implement this metadata parsing later once the basic evaluation pipeline is fully stable.
